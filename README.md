## Studio_Ghibli_CLI

Hi there! Welcome to my CLI application! You'll get an overview of [the Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com) movie lists. You'll have several options to get detail information based on the movie you select.  

## Installation

Please make sure you have the following gems on your gemfile:

```ruby
gem "pry"
gem "json"
gem "rest-client"
gem 'colorize', '~> 0.8.1'
```

And then execute:

$ bundle install 
 Usage of ghibli-cli

To run the application, $ ruby bin/run
	
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/run` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
